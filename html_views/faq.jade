<div class="faq-container"><div class="header">bitconnect FAQ</div><div class="faq-q">- Mission statement</div><div class="faq-a">We love bitcoin. We think it’s amazing. It’s absolutely brilliant, and we believe it’s just what the world needs.<br/>Our goal is to make bitcoin succeed.<br/>Bitcoin is still limited in its adoption. In order to make bitcoin succeed, mass adoption must occur. Our belief is that in order for mass adoption of bitcoin to occur, these things must occur:
- bitcoin should be easier to use.<br/>- bitcoin should be easy to acquire by the masses<br/>- it should be easier for professionals and businesses to start accepting bitcoin.</div><div class="faq-q">- what is bitconnect?</div><div class="faq-a">bitconnect is a better bitcoin wallet. It’s the easiest bitcoin wallet yet.<br/>It’s a social bitcoin wallet - it integrates with facebook and makes sending bitcoin as easy as sending a facebook message.<br/>This means that you can easily send bitcoin to your facebook friends, and to other facebook users who are signed up to bitconnect by just entering their name.</div><div class="faq-q">- What are other advantages of bitconnect?</div><div class="faq-a">If you use bitconnect, and if you choose, you will never have to see another bitcoin address again. All bitconnect interaction with bitcoin and other users of bitcoin is as easy as knowing their name. Bitcoin addresses are behind the scenes, and should stay there.</div><div class="faq-q">- Hey, can I still use the old-fashioned bitcoin addresses?</div><div class="faq-a">Sure, you can always still use them if you wish. bitconnect supports all standard functionality of a bitcoin wallet. It’s designed to be your only bitcoin wallet. It can do what any of them do, plus more, and much better.</div><div class="faq-q">- How do I get it?</div><div class="faq-a">Just go to http://bitconnect.me on any web-browser and click the “bitconnect me with facebook”</div><div class="faq-q">- How do I get it?</div><div class="faq-a">Yes, we rely on facebook for almost all interactions. We do this for several reasons.<br/>- Everybody is on facebook (well… almost everybody).<br/>- People are used to sending facebook messages using their friends’ names, and we wish bitconnect to be as easy as that.<br/>- Additionally, we do this for what we call “organic trust”. That’s trust that doesn’t come from computer security or cryptography, it’s person-to-person trust. Facebook accounts are harder to fake than email accounts, and if we see someone who has 600 friends and is on facebook for 7 years, we know it’s more likely to be a real person than someone who just signed up and has no friends. When the new user with no friends suddenly has 50 friends and invites all of them we might start suspecting that it’s fake users and might be someone who wants to misuse the system.</div><div class="faq-q">- do you plan on adding social networks, or signing up with just email or a phone number?</div><div class="faq-a">Currently, no. We need the organic trust that facebook provides to improve the security of our community. However, at some point, we might add other ways to verify your identity in order to provide similar levels of security without a facebook account.</div><div class="faq-q">- do you plan on adding social networks, or signing up with just email or a phone number?</div><div class="faq-a">Currently, no. We need the organic trust that facebook provides to improve the security of our community. However, at some point, we might add other ways to verify your identity in order to provide similar levels of security without a facebook account.</div><div class="faq-q">- I signed up, but I would like to close my facebook account. Will I still be able to use bitconnect?</div><div class="faq-a">No. We’re afraid it’s tied to your facebook account, and will not work without it.</div><div class="faq-q"> - I have forgotten my password. What now?</div><div class="faq-a">If you forgot your facebook password, just reset it through facebook. If you forgot your bitconnect password, you’ve got a problem. The security architecture of bitconnect does not allow us to retrieve you password. In fact, we never even receive your password, so there is nothing we can do. Keep trying until you guess your password.<br/><br/>If you just cannot remember it, your satoshis in your bitconnect address will be gone forever. However, your thanx are still safe. As long as you can access your facebook account, you can access your bitconnect wallet and your thanx in it.</div><div class="faq-q"> - My facebook password is not very secure. Should I be worried?</div><div class="faq-a">We strongly recommend always using a secure password for your online accounts. You should also select a strong password for the bitconnect bitcoin address</div><div class="faq-q"> - Hey, how come I never needed to enter a password to sign up?</div><div class="faq-a">bitconnect uses your facebook credentials to sign you up. You will only need a to enter a password when you use the bitcoin functionality of bitconnect.</div><div class="faq-q"> - Can I use bitconnect on my phone? How about on the computer?</div><div class="faq-a">Yup, you can use bitconnect on any device with a web browser. Just go to http://bitconnect.me</div><div class="faq-q"> - Do I have to do download an app?</div><div class="faq-a">Nope, bitconnect is a web-app, so there’s nothing to download.</div><div class="faq-q"> - I have an iPhone, can I use bitconnect on it? I heard apple banned all bitcoin apps.</div><div class="faq-a">That’s the beauty of bitconnect. It’s a web-app, so you can use it in any web browser. On iPhone you can use Safari for example. Apple cannot block that. Ever.</div><div class="faq-q"> - Hey, I’d like to have an icon on my phone that takes me to my wallet.</div><div class="faq-a">No problem, follow these instructions for iPhone, and Android</div><div class="faq-q"> - I have an android device, can I use bitconnect?</div><div class="faq-a">Absolutely. use the web browser to go to http://bitconnect.me</div><div class="faq-q"> - Are you planning native apps?</div><div class="faq-a">Yes. Android coming soon. iOS is a problem as Apple does not permit bitcoin wallets on the AppStore. However, if they ever allow it, you’ll be seeing bitconnect there as well.</div><div class="faq-q"> - What are other advantages of bitconnect?</div><div class="faq-a">In order to make bitconnect extremely user friendly, we have created a fee-less, zero confirmation, off-chain transaction currency called “thanx”. Here’s what this means:<br/>1. Fee-less
The bitcoin system sometimes requires a transaction fee. Transactions of 0.01 BTC or less require a fee of at least 0.0001 BTC. The bitcoin protocol enforces these fees in order to make it expensive to send “spam”  bitcoin transactions. The fees go to the bitcoin miners as a reward for confirming your transaction.<br/>bitconnect gives you more choice as to these fees. Our solution is another currency in the system, which does not require you to pay transaction fees. For this purpose, we created a secondary currency in the system called “thanx”. It’s a play on the word “thanks”, and it represents our thanks to you for using bitconnect.<br/><br/>2. Zero confirmation
The bitcoin system uses a brilliant system of “blocks” in order to achieve complete decentralization. On average, every ten minutes, a new block is “mined” by the bitcoin system, which generates new bitcoins, and “confirms” transactions in the system since the last block. This means that when you make a bitcoin transaction, you only really know that the transfer has succeeded after a few blocks are mined afterwards. This could take several minutes, to over an hour sometimes.<br/><br/>3. Off-chain<br/>Since the thanx are off the blockchain, no confirmations are necessary to be sure that the transfer has succeeded. This allows you to have more confidence and peace of mind when using the system.</div><div class="faq-q"> - Wait a minute, so we have bitcoin, and we have thanx? please explain… what’s satoshi?</div><div class="faq-a">satoshi is the smallest part of a bitcoin that exists today. It is named after the (anonymous) inventor of bitcoin - Satoshi Nakamoto, and is equal to 0.00000001 BTC (in other words, there are 100,000,000 satoshi in one bitcoin). It’s transferred on the bitcoin network.</div><div class="faq-q"> - What’s thanx?</div><div class="faq-a">One thanx is equal to one satoshi, but thanx are only available to bitconnect users. thanx are there to avoid transaction costs, allow for zero confirmation transactions, and allow for reversible transactions as long as the other side hasn’t accepted them, as well as other features that make the system more user friendly and give you more options as to how you use it. You can turn thanx into satoshi and satoshi into thanx easily on the “me” screen.</div><div class="faq-q"> - Reward system</div><div class="faq-a">I will be giving away 12,345,678,910 thanx (that’s 12,345,678,910 satoshis, or 123.45678910 BTC) as rewards in the system. We give you thanks for a bunch of stuff. Like for signing up, for getting your friends to sign up, and for things like verifying your phone number.<br/><br/>+ 1234 thanx if you sign up without an invitation<br/>+ 12345 thanx if you sign up through an invitation.<br/>+ 12345 thanx divided equally among the friends who invited you. So if I invite a friend, and they sign up, both they and I receive 12345 thanx each. So you are encouraged to invite all your friends.<br/>+ 123456 thanx when you verify a mobile number<br/>+ once these thanx are all rewarded to users, I will determine whether I wish to continue the reward system. At the current reward amounts, we’re talking about about 2 million sign-ups. If I manage that, I think I created a system that works, and very likely will keep the rewards going.</div><div class="faq-q"> - my facebook friend is not signed up to bitconnect, can I still send them?</div><div class="faq-a">Yes! You can send thanx to facebook friends who are not signed up, they will get an invitation to join, and when they do, what you sent them will be waiting for them.</div><div class="faq-q"> - I invited a friend to join and sent him thanx, but he’s not joining. Can I get the thanx back?</div><div class="faq-a">Sure, just cancel the transaction and the thanx will be back with you</div><div class="faq-q"> - I’m loving this… how do I invite my facebook friends to join?</div><div class="faq-a">Tap on the connect icon in the main screen and you will get a list of all your facebook friends where you’ll be able to invite them. You can invite one by one, several together, or all at once. If any of your friends are already signed up, you will see them under the section “bitconnected facebook friends”. The rest of your facebook friends will have an “invite” button next to them.</div><div class="faq-q"> - who are you?</div><div class="faq-a">My name is Ofir Dotan. This is my facebook profile https://www.facebook.com/ofir.dotan
I am from Israel, and I love bitcoin. I’ve been following bitcoin for close to two years, and I’ve had the idea for bitconnect brewing in my mind for about a year and a half now.</div><div class="faq-q"> - who wrote bitconnect?</div><div class="faq-a">About six months ago, I had the great pleasure of being in close contact with Vitalik Buterin, one of the leading minds in the bitcoin sphere and inventor of ethereum. I told him about my idea and he was helpful enough to code the basic hard-core bitcoin functionality for me. It helped me kickstart my project, and after months of bringing it to a finished product, I am ready to release it to the world.</div><div class="faq-q"> - what’s the background for bitconnect?</div><div class="faq-a">I realized that in order for bitcoin to succeed, it needs to reach the masses. In order for that to happen it needs to be very very easy and fun to use. bitconnect attempts to make bitcoin accessible to the masses by putting it on facebook, where people who have never heard of bitcoin might give it a try, as well as making it as easy as using facebook to send a message.</div><div class="faq-q"> - is it safe?</div><div class="faq-a">bitconnect is a hybrid wallet. That means that half of your private key is stored on our server, but the other half is derived from the password you choose for your wallet. That means that a malicious user who wanted to steal your bitcoins would have to break into your facebook account, *and* know the password you chose for your bitconnect wallet. If you make sure both your facebook password, as well as your bitconnect password are very secure, you can be confident that your bitcoins are safe. If any of this information is compromised, you should change your password.</div><div class="faq-q"> - what’s send?</div><div class="faq-a">If you want to send someone thanx or satoshi, you use send.</div><div class="faq-q"> - what’s request?</div><div class="faq-a">If you want to ask someone to send you thanx or satoshi, you use request.</div><div class="faq-q"> - i have sent thanx to someone, and I see “cancel” next to that transaction. why’s that?</div><div class="faq-a">You can cancel your thanx transactions and requests as long as the other side has not accepted them. We do this to try to help users with “bitcoin anxiety”. In the bitcoin world if you make a mistake while sending, there is noting you can do. the only way to reverse the transaction is if the receiver sends the money back to you.<br/><br/>In bitconnect, it’s important for us that the user has no fear of making mistakes. that’s why we added this feature. if you make a mistake, you can cancel it as long as the other side hasn’t accepted the transaction.</div><div class="faq-q"> - is bitconnect centralized?</div><div class="faq-a">for your satoshi balance, bitconnect is as decentralized as bitcoin. For the thanx in the system, we use a central database.</div><div class="faq-q"> - are my bitcoins safe? do I need to trust you not to steal them?</div><div class="faq-a">bitconnect is a “hybrid” bitcoin wallet. that means that in order to transfer the bitcoins in your wallet, the password which you select for the wallet is necessary. The password *never* leaves your browser window, and *never* reaches our server. it’s 100% client side, meaning that without it, we cannot take your money.</div><div class="faq-q"> - How can I be sure that I can always withdraw my thanx or satoshis?</div><div class="faq-a">All satoshis in the system are real satoshis on the bitcoin network. You can see they are all there. If you go to the “me” screen, you will see your bitconnect bitcoin address, and you can click it and you’ll be taken to blockchain.info which will display your bitcoins in that address.<br/><br/>Additionally, all thanx in the system are backed up by real satoshis, whether the rewards we’re giving away for sign-ups etc, or satoshis sent in by users into the system. Most of the satoshis are stored in our cold storage address, and the rest are in a hot wallet, to allow for quick withdraw of satoshis.<br/><br/>We have developed a proof-of-reserve audit function which will allow you to verify that the satoshis are all there at all times.</div><div class="faq-q"> - How do I turn satoshi into thanx and thanx into satoshi?</div><div class="faq-a">Easy, go to the me screen. You’ll see it there.</div><div class="faq-q"> -my facebook got hacked. are my bitcoins safe?</div><div class="faq-a">If you chose a strong password for your bitconnect password then most likely that you are ok. Still, you should change your facebook password immediately to something secure that you do not use anywhere else.</div><div class="faq-q"> - Why do I need to verify my phone number to withdraw?</div><div class="faq-a">We do this to make the system more secure. We don’t want someone to create many fake facebook accounts in order to get the reward, and then just withdraw them, so we make you verify a mobile phone number before you can send your thanx or satoshis to another bitcoin address</div><div class="faq-q"> - Can I send to a standard bitcoin address? One that is not on bitconnect?</div><div class="faq-a">Sure, just enter the address in the “connect with” screen. You can scan a QR code, or copy and paste it. You can also enter it manually (but we don’t recommended that, to avoid mistakes).</div><div class="faq-q"> - I have bitcoins of my own outside of bitconnect, can I use them on bitconnect?</div><div class="faq-a">Sure, just send them to your bitconnect bitcoin address and they’ll appear under your satoshi balance. You can then turn them into thanx.</div></div>
